# Wordle Feature
This is a take-home challenge based on the viral word game, [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). The goal is to re-create one of the game's features. 

## User Stories
- [x] I want to see if the letter I picked is in the correct position, misplaced, or wrong.
- [x] I want the UI to update based on my answer.

I chose to work on these features because they are an important part of Wordle's logic and thought that it'd be an interesting task to try to re-create them.

## Possible improvements
- Add an on-screen keyboard to make the game mobile-friendly. 
- Check if the word tested is an actual English word.
- Display the correct letters tested by the user.
