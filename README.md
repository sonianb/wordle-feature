# Wordle Feature
This is a take-home challenge based on the viral word game, [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). The goal is to re-create one of the game's features. 

## User Stories
- [x] I want to see if the letter I picked is in the correct position, misplaced, or wrong.
- [x] I want the UI to update based on my answer.

I chose to work on these user stories because they are an important part of the game's logic and it'd be a great challenge to try to re-create them.

## Stretch goals
- [ ] Add an on-screen keyboard to make the game more mobile-friendly. 
- [ ] Update the UI with the letters the user has already tested.
